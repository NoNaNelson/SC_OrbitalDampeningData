## Orbital Dampening - an advanced snaring technique
-# found tested by BarecGesh and optimized by NoNaNelson

Orbital Dampening is a form of effectively snaring ships within the gravity field of stellar objects

## THE THEORY BEHIND IT
for any given route, the smallest, the travel corridor of a route will ever be is at the droupout point, when they exit quantum travel.
If you could wait at that point, you would not need to care about server boundaries. Another point is, that after Quantum travel, especially longer ones liek Hurston > Arccorp, the average QT cooldown time is around 15 seconds, giving you enough time to close the distance and dampen them and because they wont expect it, they will not realize whats happening until its too late
sadly this can still be circumvented by doglegs but your chance is higher catching one since you will be way closer and you might be able to spot someone at larger distances

so if you now want to archive a orbital dampen from Hurston to ArcCorp, you need to stay at/near the dropout point, 880km away moving 494m/s against the rotation of the planet

## The Game
in star citizen, planets rotate, always counter clockwise when looking from OM1 - this will be our "up" from now on

if we now want to stay on a spot on that snare line within the gravity field, we need to match the rotation of the planet at  that point. it is crucial to stay at that distance  (see yellow lines, objects closer move slower since both line have the same angular momentum)
i have precalculated these speeds and attached below - might need adjustment in the future

## Quick Guide:
1. get on the snare line of your intended route. the closer to the to the centre line the better

2. complete the jump all the way to the end.
3. make sure the OM1 point of your respective Planet/Moon is **UP** relative to you so that OM3/OM4/OM5/OM6 form a line and are in a plane with your ship

4. star moving LEFT  while making sure your ship's crosshair is dead centre on the Planet/Moon. the speed you want to archive will be listed below

5. keep this vector relative to the planet. you can use different methods to keep yourself in the right position

    a. **decoupled  with speed limiter:** set decoupled to ON, and set your max speed to your target speed. if you now keep applying a pure left boost while keeping your crosshair on the planets QT marker you will stay on position. looking slightly to the left, will move you to the "left"/accelerate you and move you away in your orbit while going slightly to the right will archive the opposite effect --- *this is more of a fine tuning technique*

    b. **using /showlocation and/or r_displayinfo 2 or higher:** use /showlocation as you drop out to "find" your dropout point, then use snareplan's *position navigation tool* to stay in the right position - just remember to swap left/right if you are looking at your destiantion planet --- *this is more of a imprecise methods its error and time delay make it hard to use*

##  Notes: 

* you dont have to be directly on point, targets usually drop out within 10km, giving you enough time to adjust your vector and dampen the target
* make sure your distance to the destination planet/moon stays the same as when you dropped out! if you are closer you will be offset to the left while too far away will offset you to the right
* it is worth, waiting 2-3 seconds to offset your postion before starting to counter the rotation, due  to lags and desync and delayed markers, so that when you actually see them, they appear right next to you
* most importantly, this technique **DOES NOT** require a mantis, meaning you can use this in ANY Dampener capable ship, like the Cutlass BLue, Scorpius Antares or the Guardian QI - but i'd still recommend it
* as of 4.0 and server meshing, snareing is bugged, because of server boundaries - this type of interdiction is not affected by this
